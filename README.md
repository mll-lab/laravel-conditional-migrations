Run migrations only if a condition is true

Based on https://github.com/onlinepets/laravel-conditional-migrations

## Installation

Via [composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    composer require mll-lab/laravel-conditional-migrations

## Usage

To run a migration conditionally, implement the `ConditionalMigration`
interface and its `->shouldRun()` method:

```php
use MLL\ConditionalMigrations\Contracts\ConditionalMigration;
use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;

class DoSomethingVeryIntensive extends Migration implements ConditionalMigration
{
    public function up() { ... }
    public function down() { ... }

    public function shouldRun(): bool
    {
        return (new Carbon('1 AM'))->lessThan(now())
            && (new Carbon('2 AM'))->greaterThan(now());
    }
}
```

The code snippet above will make sure the `do_something_very_intensive` migration
will be skipped unless it is executed between 1 AM and 2 AM. This can be useful
if your migration does something that should not be run during the daytime, like
adding an index to a table containing lots of data.

## Configuration

You can optionally publish the configuration file:

    php artisan vendor:publish --tags=conditional-migrations-config

This will create the file `config/conditional-migrations.php`.

The `always_run` option allows you to overrule the conditions set in individual migrations.

```php
'always_run' => env('APP_DEBUG', false),
``` 

You can also use a closure if you want to do more advanced calculations:

```php
'always_run' => function (): bool {
    // calculate if migrations should always run
},
```
